# Project Title


A Javascript Selenium test framework using Mocha and Chai


## Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to run the test
- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/en/download/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?wt.mc_id=vscom_downloads)
  

## Test Scenario

User opens google and searches for Selenium and clicks on the first matching link and validates the opening title of the official selenium site


## Installing

After successfully installing node and an IDE, use the following command to install all the libraries required for running the test framework

    node install

This command will install all the preliminary libraries required to run a node project along with the libraries mentioned in our package.json file.
The libraries mentioned in our package.json file will differ from project to project hence it is important to mention the libraries required. Alternately we 
can install the libraries individually and those libraries will show up on the file.


## Running the tests

Note : Node must be installed on the system before running the tests. Mocha and chai will be installed automatically when node install is run.

      node run test
      or
      node test

## Built With

  - [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) - Without which automation testing just does not work
  - [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) - For building the asynchronous test framework
  - [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) - Assertion library
